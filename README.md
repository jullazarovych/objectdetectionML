# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a custom object detection system that can recognize specific items in a room using a YOLOv5 model deployed on a Raspberry Pi 3. The system will use the Raspberry Pi Camera Module to capture real-time video feed and perform object detection with a focus on efficiency and accuracy.
