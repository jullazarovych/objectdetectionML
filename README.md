# Project Overview
This project uses YOLOv5 to detect whether people are wearing face masks correctly. It classifies images into three categories: with mask, without mask, and mask worn incorrectly. The model was trained on a custom dataset with annotations converted from Pascal VOC to YOLO format. It includes tools for evaluation and visualization, highlighting false positives and false negatives to better understand model performance.
